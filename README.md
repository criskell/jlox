# jlox

A tree-walker interpreter for the Lox language written in Java, based on the great book Crafting Interpreters. Here I try to add inline annotations from my studies, complete challenges, and test new approaches.

## Features

- Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Analysis
- Lexical scope and closures
- Recursive descent parser
- Control flow (if, for and while loops)
- Functions
- Variable detection in a semantic analysis pass
- Classes and inheritance
